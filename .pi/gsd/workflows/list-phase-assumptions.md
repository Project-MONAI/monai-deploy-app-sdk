## Context (pre-injected by WXP)

**Phase:** <gsd-paste name="phase" />

**Phase Data:**
<gsd-paste name="init" />

**State:**
<gsd-paste name="state" />

<purpose>
Surface the agent's assumptions about a phase before planning, enabling users to correct misconceptions early.

Key difference from discuss-phase: This is ANALYSIS of what the agent thinks, not INTAKE of what user knows. No file output - purely conversational to prompt discussion.
</purpose>

<process>

<step name="validate_phase" priority="first">
<!-- Phase number, phase data and state are pre-injected above via WXP -->

Parse `init` JSON for: `phase_found`, `phase_number`, `phase_name`, `phase_slug`, `goal`, `phase_dir`.

**If `phase_found` is false:**

```
Error: Phase {phase} not found in roadmap.

Available phases: [list from roadmap]

Usage: /gsd-list-phase-assumptions [phase-number]
Example: /gsd-list-phase-assumptions 3
```

Exit workflow.

**If `phase_found` is true:** Continue to analyze_phase.
</step>

<step name="analyze_phase">
Based on roadmap description and project context, identify assumptions across five areas:

**1. Technical Approach:**
What libraries, frameworks, patterns, or tools would the agent use?
- "I'd use X library because..."
- "I'd follow Y pattern because..."
- "I'd structure this as Z because..."

**2. Implementation Order:**
What would the agent build first, second, third?
- "I'd start with X because it's foundational"
- "Then Y because it depends on X"
- "Finally Z because..."

**3. Scope Boundaries:**
What's included vs excluded in the agent's interpretation?
- "This phase includes: A, B, C"
- "This phase does NOT include: D, E, F"
- "Boundary ambiguities: G could go either way"

**4. Risk Areas:**
Where does the agent expect complexity or challenges?
- "The tricky part is X because..."
- "Potential issues: Y, Z"
- "I'd watch out for..."

**5. Dependencies:**
What does the agent assume exists or needs to be in place?
- "This assumes X from previous phases"
- "External dependencies: Y, Z"
- "This will be consumed by..."

Be honest about uncertainty. Mark assumptions with confidence levels:
- "Fairly confident: ..." (clear from roadmap)
- "Assuming: ..." (reasonable inference)
- "Unclear: ..." (could go multiple ways)
</step>

<step name="present_assumptions">
Present assumptions in a clear, scannable format:

```
## My Assumptions for Phase ${PHASE}: ${PHASE_NAME}

### Technical Approach
[List assumptions about how to implement]

### Implementation Order
[List assumptions about sequencing]

### Scope Boundaries
**In scope:** [what's included]
**Out of scope:** [what's excluded]
**Ambiguous:** [what could go either way]

### Risk Areas
[List anticipated challenges]

### Dependencies
**From prior phases:** [what's needed]
**External:** [third-party needs]
**Feeds into:** [what future phases need from this]

**What do you think?**

Are these assumptions accurate? Let me know:
- What I got right
- What I got wrong
- What I'm missing
```

Wait for user response.
</step>

<step name="gather_feedback">
**If user provides corrections:**

Acknowledge the corrections:

```
Key corrections:
- [correction 1]
- [correction 2]

This changes my understanding significantly. [Summarize new understanding]
```

**If user confirms assumptions:**

```
Assumptions validated.
```

Continue to offer_next.
</step>

<step name="offer_next">
Present next steps:

```
What's next?
1. Discuss context (/gsd-discuss-phase ${PHASE}) - Let me ask you questions to build comprehensive context
2. Plan this phase (/gsd-plan-phase ${PHASE}) - Create detailed execution plans
3. Re-examine assumptions - I'll analyze again with your corrections
4. Done for now
```

Wait for user selection.

If "Discuss context": Note that CONTEXT.md will incorporate any corrections discussed here
If "Plan this phase": Proceed knowing assumptions are understood
If "Re-examine": Return to analyze_phase with updated understanding
</step>
