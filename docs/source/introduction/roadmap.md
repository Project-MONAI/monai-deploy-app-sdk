# Roadmap

The first versions of the MONAI Deploy App SDK offer a core framework to build & package healthcare AI apps so that they can be deployed to a production environment.

We are currently in the process of refining the roadmap for the product based on the communityâ€™s input, though it is clear that on the roadmap are more built-in DICOM parsing and DICOM OID generation capabilities to better support [IHE AIR profiles](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_Suppl_AIR_Rev1-2_TI_2022-07-06.pdf), as well as serving model network in a separate process using [Triton](https://developer.nvidia.com/triton-inference-server) and potentially utilizing [Nvidia Inference Microservices](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/).
