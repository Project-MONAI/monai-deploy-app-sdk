# Roadmap

The first versions of the MONAI Deploy App SDK offer a core framework to build & package healthcare AI apps so that they can be deployed to a production environment.

We are currently in the process of refining the roadmap for the product based on the community’s input, though it is clear that on the roadmap are more built-in DICOM parsing and DICOM OID generation capabilities to better support [IHE AIR profiles](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_Suppl_AIR_Rev1-2_TI_2022-07-06.pdf), as well as serving model network in a separate process using [Triton](https://developer.nvidia.com/triton-inference-server).
