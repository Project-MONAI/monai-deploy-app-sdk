# Version 0.3.0 (April 22, 2022)

This version of MONAI Deploy App SDK introduces a couple of new features, as well as a number of defect fixes. Please see details in the following sections.

Please visit [GETTING STARTED](/getting_started/index) guide and follow tutorials.

You can learn more about SDK usage through [DEVELOPING WITH SDK](/developing_with_sdk/index).

## What's new

### Clara Viz Operator

This operator uses [Clara Viz](https://pypi.org/project/clara-viz/) to provide interactive view of a 3D volume including segmentation mask. A [tutorial](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-sdk/blob/main/notebooks/tutorials/03_segmentation_viz_app.ipynb) is provided to demonstrate how to use this new operator in an application, e.g., a typical segmentation inference application.

### STL Surface Mesh Conversion Operator

This operator converts a volume image to surface mesh, in [STL file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)). Its API allows the client to control if smoothing needs to be applied, and if only keeping the largest connected component; the latter is useful when muliple disjoint segments are in a volume image, and the application needs to control if all or only the largest to be included in the output.

## What's fixed/updated

- [The AI Spleen Segmentation](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-sdk/tree/main/examples/apps/ai_spleen_seg_app) application is updated to include the STL conversion operator for surface mesh output
- [The AI UNETR Segmentation](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-sdk/blob/main/examples/apps/ai_unetr_seg_app/app.py) is updated to include the STL conversion operator, in lieu of the [DICOM Segmentation Writer](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-sdk/blob/main/monai/deploy/operators/dicom_seg_writer_operator.py). This is because that the model outputs 13 labeled segments, exceeding the maximum of 8 supported by the [DICOM Segmentation Writer](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-sdk/blob/main/monai/deploy/operators/dicom_seg_writer_operator.py)
