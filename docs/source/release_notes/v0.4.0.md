# Version 0.4.0



## What's new in 0.4.0
- New operator to automate inference with the newly introduced [MONAI Bundle](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/whatsnew_0_9.html)

### MONAI Bundle Inference Operator

The new operator, `MONAI Bundle Inference Operator`, is intended to automate the inference with a MONAI Bundle in TorchScript with the following functionalities:
- Parse the model metadata and extra configuration data in the TorchScript file
- Instanciate MONAI transforms and inferer objects per bundle configuration data
- Convert input/output of the operator to and from model network input
- Support named model and can be used in a multi-model application

The example [spleen segmentation application](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-sdk/tree/main/examples/apps/ai_spleen_seg_app) was accordingly updated to demonstrate the use of this new operator with the newly published [Spleen CT Segmentation Bundle](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models/spleen_ct_segmentation).

More details are in the [tutorial](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-sdk/blob/main/notebooks/tutorials/06_monai_bundle_app.ipynb).
