# Version 0.5.0

## What's new in 0.5.0
- App SDK is now compatible with MONAI v0.9.1 and later
- DICOM Encapsulated PDF Writer. This built-in operator provides a simple and easy way to encapsulate PDF contents in a DICOM instance with or without referenced original DICOM instance(s)
- DICOM Segmentation Writer with <a href="https://highdicom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html">highdicom</a> back end. This improves the description of segments with proper DICOM coding sequence(s)
- Support DICOM instance level attribute matching in the DICOM Series Selection Operator
- Operators and example applications are verified to be re-runable without needing to reinitialize the application object or re-load the AI model network. This will allow a main function or an external script to instantiate the application object once and use it to process multiple discreet inputs, either in a batch processing mode or in a long running service
- Tutorials, in Jupyter notebooks, are re-organized and updated
- Reference added for <a href"<a href="https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy/releases">MONAI Deploy</a>">MONAI Deploy Express</a> for hosting MAPs in development environments
-  Removed is the reference to the deprecated MONAI Inference Service
