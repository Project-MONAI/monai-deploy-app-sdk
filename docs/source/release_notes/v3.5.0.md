# Version 3.5.0 ( January 2026)

## What's new in 3.5.0

- Tested with the latest MONAI v1.5.1 and Holoscan v3.10 CUDA 12 version, [holoscan-cu12](https://pypi.org/project/holoscan-cu12).
- Updated the compressed DICOM image decoder plugin for PyDicom, which is based on nvImageCodec for GPU-accelerated image frame decoding. This decoder is dynamically registered at runtime with PyDicom as the first choice for the supported transfer syntaxes.
  - Updated the function to get decode parameters for nvImgCodec to handle YBR to RGB conversion such that the decompressed pixel data matches that from PyDicom's existing plug-ins.
  - Udpated the tests and decoding performance measurements and comparison.
