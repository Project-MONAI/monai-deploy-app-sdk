# Version 0.5.1 (July 12, 2023)

This is a patch release of [v0.5](https://docs.monai.io/projects/monai-deploy-app-sdk/en/stable/release_notes/v0.5.0.html#), to address compatibility
issues with newer versions of dependent packages, as well as adding enhancements to built-in operators.

## What's new

- Starting with this release, support [typeguard](https://typeguard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) v3.0.0 and above
    - typeguard v3.0.0 introduced breaking changes in its API, causing failure in the App SDK v0.5 since it was implemented using earlier versions
    - work-around with pinning the typeguard version to v2 must be removed in the applications' dependency requirements
- Python 3.8 and above are now required
- Enhancement to support running Jupyter Notebooks with Python 3.10
- New NIfTI data loader operator
- Enhancements to inference operator, DICOM Seg Writer operator, CLI Packager, and more, see details below
