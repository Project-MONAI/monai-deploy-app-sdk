# Version 2.0.0 (April 24th, 2024)

## What's new in 3.0.0

- This version of the App SDK is based on the newly released [Holoscan SDK v3](https://pypi.org/project/holoscan/), and is expected to be so with future minor releases of Holoscan SDK v3.

- Starting with version 3.0.0, [Holoscan SDK](https://pypi.org/project/holoscan/) and [Holoscan CLI](https://pypi.org/project/holoscan-cli/) are released in separate packages, and as such, this version of the MONAI Deploy App SDK has both as dependencies. As of now, version 3 of both packages are compatible.

- Remote inference on [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server) is now supported. Effort was made to make it user-friendly so existing example applications can be easily converted to use this feature by simply providing the network location of the server as well as the [Triton model configuration file](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md) sans the actual model files. [An example application](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-sdk/tree/main/examples/apps/ai_remote_infer_app) has been provided to demonstrate such use case.

### Key changes

- [Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Cente](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/) researchers, @[Bryan](https://github.com/bluna301) @[Will](https://github.com/WillButAgain) and Elan, contributed numerous enhancements from experience developing and deploying MONAI based AI applications in clinical environments, to name but a few

  - Enhanced the DICOM data loader to handle multi-phase DICOM series where multiple acquisitions exist and some DICOM SOP instances have the same image pospositiontion patient.

  - Enahnced the DICOM series to volume operator to better handle the data types of the converted volume image for improved efficiency and memory usage.

  - Enhanced the DICOM Segmentation operator to populate DICOM tags with AI model information which are consistent with other DICOM writers in the SDK.
