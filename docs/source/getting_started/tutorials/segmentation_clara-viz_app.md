# Creating a Segmentation App Including Including Visualization with Clara-Viz

This tutorial shows how to create an organ segmentation application for a PyTorch model that has been trained with MONAI, and visualize the segmentation and input images with Clara Viz integration.

## Setup

```bash
# Create a virtual environment with Python 3.7.
# Skip if you are already in a virtual environment.
# (JupyterLab dropped its support for Python 3.6 since 2021-12-23.
#  See https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/11740)
conda create -n monai python=3.7 pytorch torchvision jupyterlab cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c conda-forge
conda activate monai

# Launch JupyterLab if you want to work on Jupyter Notebook
jupyter-lab
```

## Executing from Jupyter Notebook
