# Creating a Segmentation App Including Including Visualization with Clara-Viz

This tutorial shows how to create an organ segmentation application for a PyTorch model that has been trained with MONAI, and provide interactive visualization of the segmentation and input images with Clara Viz integration.

## Setup

```bash
# Create a virtual environment with Python 3.8.
# Skip if you are already in a virtual environment.
conda create -n monai python=3.8 pytorch torchvision jupyterlab cudatoolkit=12.2 -c pytorch -c conda-forge
conda activate monai

# Launch JupyterLab if you want to work on Jupyter Notebook
jupyter-lab
```

## Executing from Jupyter Notebook
