# __init__.py is used to initialize a Python package
# ensures that the directory __init__.py resides in is included at the start of the sys.path
# this is useful when you want to import modules from this directory, even if itâ€™s not the
# directory where your Python script is running.

# give access to operating system and Python interpreter
import os
import sys

# grab absolute path of directory containing __init__.py
_current_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

# if sys.path is not the same as the directory containing the __init__.py file
if sys.path and os.path.abspath(sys.path[0]) != _current_dir:
    # insert directory containing __init__.py file at the beginning of sys.path
    sys.path.insert(0, _current_dir)
# delete variable
del _current_dir
