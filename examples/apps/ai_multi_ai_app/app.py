    """This example demonstrates how to create a multi-model/multi-AI application.

    The important steps are:
        1. Place the model TorchScripts in a defined folder structure, see below for details
        2. Pass the model name to the inference operator instance in the app
        3. Connect the input to and output from the inference operators, as required by the app

    Required Model Folder Structure:
        1. The model TorchScripts, be it MONAI Bundle compliant or not, must be placed in
           a parent folder, whose path is used as the path to the model(s) on app execution
        2. Each TorchScript file needs to be in a sub-folder, whose name is the model name

    An example is shown below, where the `parent_foler` name can be the app's own choosing, and
    the sub-folder names become model names, `pancreas_ct_dints` and `spleen_model`, respectively.

        <parent_fodler>
        ├── pancreas_ct_dints
        │   └── model.ts
        └── spleen_ct
            └── model.ts

    Note:
    1. The TorchScript files of MONAI Bundles can be downloaded from MONAI Model Zoo, at
       https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models
    2. The input DICOM instances are from a DICOM Series of CT Abdomen, similar to the ones
       used in the Spleen Segmentation example
    3. This example is purely for technical demonstration, not for clinical use
