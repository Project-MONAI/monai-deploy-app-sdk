    "# Creating a Deploy App with MONAI Deploy App SDK and MONAI Bundle\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to create an organ segmentation application for a PyTorch model that has been trained with MONAI and packaged in the [MONAI Bundle](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/bundle_intro.html) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying AI models requires the integration with clinical imaging network, even if in a for-research-use setting. This means that the AI deploy application will need to support standards-based imaging protocols, and specifically for Radiological imaging, DICOM protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, DICOM network communication, either in DICOM TCP/IP network protocol or DICOMWeb, would be handled by DICOM devices or services, e.g. MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway, so the deploy application itself would only need to use DICOM Part 10 files as input and save the AI result in DICOM Part10 file(s). For segmentation use cases, the DICOM instance file for AI results could be a DICOM Segmentation object or a DICOM RT Structure Set, and for classification, DICOM Structure Report and/or DICOM Encapsulated PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "When integrated with imaging networks and receiving DICOM instances from modalities and Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS), an AI deploy application has to deal with a whole DICOM study with multiple series, whose images' spacing may not be the same as expected by the trained model. To address these cases consistently and efficiently, MONAI Deploy Application SDK provides classes, called operators, to parse DICOM studies, select specific series with application-defined rules, and convert the selected DICOM series into domain-specific image format along with meta-data representing the pertinent DICOM attributes. The image is then further processed in the pre-processing stage to normalize spacing, orientation, intensity,etc, before pixel data as Tensors are used for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will demonstrate how to create a MONAI Deploy application package using the MONAI Deploy App SDK, and importantly, using the built-in MONAI Bundle Inference Operator to perform inference with the Spleen CT Segmentation PyTorch model in a MONAI Bundle.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "For local testing, if there is a lack of DICOM Part 10 files, one can use open source programs, e.g. 3D Slicer, to convert a NIfTI file to a DICOM series.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make running this example simpler, the DICOM files and the [Spleen CT Segmentation MONAI Bundle](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models/spleen_ct_segmentation), published in [MONAI Model Zoo](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo), have been packaged and shared on Google Drive.\n",

    "\n",
    "The App SDK provides a `MonaiBundleInferenceOperator` class to perform inference with a MONAI Bundle, which is essentially a PyTorch model in TorchScript with additional metadata describing the model network and processing specification. This operator uses the MONAI utilities to parse a MONAI Bundle to automatically instantiate the objects required for input and output processing as well as inference, as such it depends on MONAI transforms, inferers, and in turn their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Operator class inherits from the base [Operator](/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.core.Operator) class, and its input/output properties are specified by using [@input](/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.core.input)/[@output](/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.core.output) decorators. For the `MonaiBundleInferenceOperator` class, the input/output need to be defined to match those of the model network, both in name and data type. For the current release, an `IOMapping` object is used to connect the operator input/output to those of the model network by using the same names. This is likely to change, to be automated, in the future releases once certain limitation in the App SDK is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spleen CT Segmentation model network has a named input, called \"image\", and the named output called \"pred\", and both are of image type, which can all be mapped to the App SDK [Image](/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.core.domain.Image). This piece of information is typically acquired by examining the model metadata `network_data_format` attribute in the bundle, as seen in this [example] (https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/blob/dev/models/spleen_ct_segmentation/configs/metadata.json)."
