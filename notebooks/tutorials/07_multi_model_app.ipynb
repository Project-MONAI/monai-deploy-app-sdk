    "# Creating a Multi-AI Deploy App with Multiple Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to create an inference application with multiple models, focusing on model files organization, accessing and inferring with named model network in the application, and finally building an app package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically multiple models will work in tandem, e.g. a lung segmentation model's output, along with the original image, are then used by a lung nodule detection and classification model. There are, however, no such models in the [MONAI Model Zoo](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo) as of now. So, for illustration purpose, two independent models will be used in this example, [Spleen Segmentation](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models/spleen_ct_segmentation) and [Pancreas Segmentation](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models/pancreas_ct_dints_segmentation), both are trained with DICOM images of CT modality, and both are packaged in the [MONAI Bundle](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/bundle_intro.html) format. A single input of a CT Abdomen DICOM Series can be used for both models within the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Steps\n",
    "- Place the model TorchScripts in a defined folder structure, see below for details\n",
    "- Pass the model name to the inference operator instance in the app\n",
    "- Connect the input to and output from the inference operators, as required by the app\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Model File Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model files in TorchScript, be it MONAI Bundle compliant or not, must each be placed in an uniquely named folder. The name of this folder becomes the model network name within the application for it to retrieve the loaded model network from the execution context.\n",
    "- The folders containing the individual model file must then be place under a parent folder. The name of this folder can be any valid folder name chosen by the application developer.\n",
    "- The path of the aforementioned parent folder then needs to be used as the value for the well-known environment variable for model path.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Model File Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the models are organized as shown below.\n",
    "```\n",
    "multi_models\n",
    "├── pancreas_ct_dints\n",
    "│   └── model.ts\n",
    "└── spleen_ct\n",
    "    └── model.ts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note,\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `multi_models` is the parent folder, whose path is used as the value for setting the well-known environment variable for model path, and when using App SDK CLI to build the application package.\n",
    "- The sub-folder names become model network names, `pancreas_ct_dints` and `spleen_model`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will demonstrate how to create and package the application using these two models.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "The two models are both MONAI bundles, published in [MONAI Model Zoo](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo)\n",
    "- [spleen_ct_segmentation, v0.3.2](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models/spleen_ct_segmentation)\n",
    "- [pancreas_ct_dints_segmentation, v0.3.0](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models/pancreas_ct_dints_segmentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The DICOM CT series used as test input is downloaded from [TCIA](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/), CT Abdomen Collection ID `CPTAC-PDA` Subject ID `C3N-00198`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the DICOM files and the models have been packaged and shared on Google Drive.\n",

    "### Determining the Model Name and I/O for the Model Bundle Inference Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The App SDK provides a `MonaiBundleInferenceOperator` class to perform inference with a MONAI Bundle, which is essentially a PyTorch model in TorchScript with additional metadata describing the model network and processing specification. This operator uses the MONAI utilities to parse a MONAI Bundle to automatically instantiate the objects required for input and output processing as well as inference, as such it depends on MONAI transforms, inferers, and in turn their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Operator class inherits from the base `Operator` class, and its named input/output properties are specified by using the function `setup`. For the `MonaiBundleInferenceOperator` class, the input/output need to be defined to match those of the model network, both in name and data type. For the current release, an `IOMapping` object is used to connect the operator input/output to those of the model network by matching the names. This is subject to change in the future releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple models are used in an application, it is important that each model network name is passed in when creating the inference operator, via the `model_name` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the Spleen CT Segmentation and Pancreas model networks have a named input, called \"image\", and a named output called \"pred\", both are of image type. These can all be mapped to the App SDK [Image](/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.core.domain.Image). The information on model network input and output data types is typically acquired by examining the model metadata `network_data_format` in the MONAI Bundle, as seen in this [example] (https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/blob/dev/models/spleen_ct_segmentation/configs/metadata.json)."
