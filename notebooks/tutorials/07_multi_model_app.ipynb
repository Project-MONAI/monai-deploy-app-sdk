    "# Creating a Deploy App for Multi-Ai with Multiple Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to create an inference application with multiple models, focusing on model files organization, inferring with named model in the application, and packaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically multiple models will work in tandem, e.g. a lung segmentation model's output, along with the original image, are be used by a lung nodule detection and classification model. However, there are currently no such models in the [MONAI Model Zoo](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo), so two independent models will be used in this example, [Spleen Segmentation](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models/spleen_ct_segmentation) and [Pancreas Segmentation](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models/pancreas_ct_dints_segmentation), both are trained with DICOM images of CT modality, and both are packaged in the [MONAI Bundle](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/bundle_intro.html) format. A single input of a CT Abdomen DICOM Series can be used for both models within the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Steps\n",
    "- Place the model TorchScripts in a defined folder structure, see below for details\n",
    "- Pass the model name to the inference operator instance in the app\n",
    "- Connect the input to and output from the inference operators, as required by the app\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Model File Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model files in TorchScript, be it MONAI Bundle compliant or not, must each be placed in an uniquely named folder. The name of this folder is used within the application to retrieve the loaded model network from the execution context.\n",
    "- The folders containing the individual model file must then be place under a parent folder. The name of this folder can be any valid folder name chosen by the application developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Model File Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the models are organized as shown below.\n",
    "```\n",
    "multi_models\n",
    "├── pancreas_ct_dints\n",
    "│   └── model.ts\n",
    "└── spleen_ct\n",
    "    └── model.ts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note,\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `multi_models` is parent folder, and its path will be used as the model path when using App SDK CLI `exec` and `package` commands.\n",
    "- The sub-folder names become model names, `pancreas_ct_dints` and `spleen_model`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will demonstrate how to create and package the application using these two models.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "The two models are both MONAI bundles, published in [MONAI Model Zoo](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo)\n",
    "- [spleen_ct_segmentation, v0.3.2](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models/spleen_ct_segmentation)\n",
    "- [pancreas_ct_dints_segmentation, v0.3.0](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/tree/dev/models/pancreas_ct_dints_segmentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The DICOM CT series used as test input is downloaded from [TCIA](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/), CT Abdomen Collection ID `CPTAC-PDA` Subject ID `C3N-00198`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the DICOM files and the models have been packaged and shared on Google Drive.\n",

    "\n",
    "The App SDK provides a `MonaiBundleInferenceOperator` class to perform inference with a MONAI Bundle, which is essentially a PyTorch model in TorchScript with additional metadata describing the model network and processing specification. This operator uses the MONAI utilities to parse a MONAI Bundle to automatically instantiate the objects required for input and output processing as well as inference, as such it depends on MONAI transforms, inferers, and in turn their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Operator class inherits from the base [Operator](/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.core.Operator) class, and its input/output properties are specified by using [@input](/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.core.input)/[@output](/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.core.output) decorators. For the `MonaiBundleInferenceOperator` class, the input/output need to be defined to match those of the model network, both in name and data type. For the current release, an `IOMapping` object is used to connect the operator input/output to those of the model network by using the same names. This is likely to change, to be automated, in the future releases once certain limitation in the App SDK is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple models are used in an application, it is important that each model network name is passed in when creating the inference operator, via the `model_name` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spleen CT Segmentation and Pancreas model networks have a named input, called \"image\", and the named output called \"pred\", and both are of image type. These can all be mapped to the App SDK [Image](/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.core.domain.Image). This piece of information is typically acquired by examining the model metadata `network_data_format` attribute in the bundle, as seen in this [example] (https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/blob/dev/models/spleen_ct_segmentation/configs/metadata.json)."
