    "# Creating a Segmentation App with MONAI Deploy App SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to create an organ segmentation application for a PyTorch model that has been trained with MONAI. Please note that this one does not require the model be a MONAI Bundle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying AI models requires the integration with clinical imaging network, even if just in a for-research-use setting. This means that the AI deploy application will need to support standards-based imaging protocols, and specifically for Radiological imaging, DICOM protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, DICOM network communication, either in DICOM TCP/IP network protocol or DICOMWeb, would be handled by DICOM devices or services, e.g. MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway, so the deploy application itself would only need to use DICOM Part 10 files as input and save the AI result in DICOM Part10 file(s). For segmentation use cases, the DICOM instance file for AI results could be a DICOM Segmentation object or a DICOM RT Structure Set, and for classification, DICOM Structure Report and/or DICOM Encapsulated PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "During model training, input and label images are typically in non-DICOM volumetric image format, e.g., NIfTI and PNG, converted from a specific DICOM study series. Furthermore, the voxel spacings most likely have been re-sampled to be uniform for all images. When integrated with imaging networks and receiving DICOM instances from modalities and Picture Archiving and Communications System, PACS, an AI deploy application has to deal with a whole DICOM study with multiple series, whose images' spacing may not be the same as expected by the trained model. To address these cases consistently and efficiently, MONAI Deploy Application SDK provides classes, called operators, to parse DICOM studies, select specific series with application-defined rules, and convert the selected DICOM series into domain-specific image format along with meta-data representing the pertinent DICOM attributes. The image is then further processed in the pre-processing stage to normalize spacing, orientation, intensity, etc., before pixel data as Tensors are used for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will demonstrate how to create a MONAI Deploy application package using the MONAI Deploy App SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "For local testing, if there is a lack of DICOM Part 10 files, one can use open source programs, e.g. 3D Slicer, to convert NIfTI to DICOM files.\n",

    "### Creating Model Specific Inference Operator classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Operator class inherits the base `Operator` class. The input/output properties are specified by implementing the `setup()` method, and the business logic implemented in the `compute()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The App SDK provides a `MonaiSegInferenceOperator` class to perform segmentation prediction with a Torch Script model. For consistency, this class uses MONAI dictionary-based transforms, as `Compose` object, for pre and post transforms. The model-specific inference operator will then only need to create the pre and post transform `Compose` based on what has been used in the model during training and validation. Note that for deploy application, `ignite` is not needed nor supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SpleenSegOperator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SpleenSegOperator` gets as input an in-memory [Image](/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.core.domain.Image) object that has been converted from a DICOM CT series by the preceding `DICOMSeriesToVolumeOperator`, and as output in-memory segmentation [Image](/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.core.domain.Image) object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pre_process` function creates the pre-transforms `Compose` object. For `LoadImage`, a specialized `InMemImageReader`, derived from MONAI `ImageReader`, is used to convert the in-memory pixel data and return the `numpy` array as well as the meta-data. Also, the DICOM input pixel spacings are often not the same as expected by the model, so the `Spacingd` transform must be used to re-sample the image with the expected spacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `post_process` function creates the post-transform `Compose` object. The `SaveImageD` transform class is used to save the segmentation mask as NIfTI image file, which is optional as the in-memory mask image will be passed down to the DICOM Segmentation writer for creating a DICOM Segmentation instance. The `Invertd` must also be used to revert the segmentation image's orientation and spacing to be the same as the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the `MonaiSegInferenceOperator` object is created, the `ROI` size is specified, as well as the transform `Compose` objects. Furthermore, the dataset image key names are set accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading of the model and performing the prediction are encapsulated in the `MonaiSegInferenceOperator` and other SDK classes. Once the inference is completed, the segmentation [Image](/modules/_autosummary/monai.deploy.core.domain.Image) object is created and set to the output by the `SpleenSegOperator`."
