# MONAI Deploy App SDK
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-green.svg)](LICENSE)


MONAI Deploy App SDK offers a framework and associated tools to design, develop and verify AI-driven applications in the healthcare imaging domain.

## Features

- Build medical imaging inference applications using a flexible, extensible & usable Pythonic API
- Easy management of inference applications via programmable Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- Built-in operators to load DICOM data to be ingested in an inference app
- Out-of-the-box support for in-proc PyTorch based inference
- Easy incorporation of MONAI based pre and post transformations in the inference application
- Package inference application with a single command into a portable MONAI Application Package
- Locally run and debug your inference application using App Runner

## User Guide

User guide is available at [docs.monai.io](https://docs.monai.io/projects/monai-deploy-app-sdk/en/stable/).

## Installation

To install [the current release](https://pypi.org/project/monai-deploy-app-sdk/), you can simply run:

```bash
pip install monai-deploy-app-sdk  # '--pre' to install a pre-release version.
```

Please also note the following system requirements:
- Ubuntu 22.04 on X86-64 is required, as this is the only X86 platform that the underlying Holoscan SDK has been tested to support as of now.
- [CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-0-0-download-archive) is required along with a supported NVIDIA GPU with at least 8GB of video RAM. If AI inference is not used in the example application and a GPU is not installed, at least [CUDA 12 runtime](https://pypi.org/project/nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12/) is required, as this is one of the requirements of Holoscan SDK, in addition, the `LIB_LIBRARY_PATH` must be set to include the installed shared library, e.g. in a Python 3.8 env, ```export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/nvidia/cuda_runtime/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH```



## Getting Started

Getting started guide is available at [here](https://docs.monai.io/projects/monai-deploy-app-sdk/en/stable/getting_started/index.html).

```bash
pip install monai-deploy-app-sdk  # '--pre' to install a pre-release version.

# Clone monai-deploy-app-sdk repository for accessing examples.
git clone https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-sdk.git
cd monai-deploy-app-sdk

# Install necessary dependencies for simple_imaging_app
pip install matplotlib Pillow scikit-image

# Execute the app locally
python examples/apps/simple_imaging_app/app.py -i examples/apps/simple_imaging_app/brain_mr_input.jpg -o output

# Package app (creating MAP Docker image), using `-l DEBUG` option to see progress.
monai-deploy package examples/apps/simple_imaging_app -c simple_imaging_app/app.yaml -t simple_app:latest --platform x64-workstation -l DEBUG

# Run the app with docker image and an input file locally
## Copy a test input file to 'input' folder
mkdir -p input && rm -rf input/*
cp examples/apps/simple_imaging_app/brain_mr_input.jpg input/
## Launch the app
monai-deploy run simple_app-x64-workstation-dgpu-linux-amd64:latest -i input -o output
```
